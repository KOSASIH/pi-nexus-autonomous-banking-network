## Overview

This project aims to explore various quantum simulations and their applications using Qiskit. Each simulation is designed to demonstrate key concepts in quantum computing and provide insights into the behavior of quantum systems.

## Simulations

### Circuit Simulation
- **File**: `circuit_simulation.py`
- **Description**: Simulates a quantum circuit with specified gates and visualizes the measurement results and state vector.

### Noise Simulation
- **File**: `noise_simulation.py`
- **Description**: Simulates the effects of noise on a quantum circuit using a depolarizing noise model and visualizes the results.

### Entanglement Simulation
- **File**: `entanglement_simulation.py`
- **Description**: Creates and visualizes a Bell state, demonstrating quantum entanglement.

### Teleportation Simulation
- **File**: `teleportation_simulation.py`
- **Description**: Simulates the quantum teleportation process, allowing the transfer of a quantum state from one qubit to another.

### Hybrid Quantum-Classical Simulation
- **File**: `hybrid_quantum_classical.py`
- **Description**: Implements the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, combining classical optimization with quantum circuits.
