## Overview

This project aims to provide a set of libraries that simplify the development of quantum algorithms and applications. Each library is designed to address specific aspects of quantum computing, making it easier for researchers and developers to implement and experiment with quantum algorithms.

## Libraries

### Qiskit Utilities
- **File**: `qiskit_utils.py`
- **Description**: Contains utility functions for creating and manipulating quantum circuits, running simulations, and visualizing results. Functions include circuit creation, state preparation, and noise application.

### Quantum State Representation
- **File**: `quantum_state.py`
- **Description**: Provides a class for representing quantum states, including methods for applying gates, measuring states, and visualizing results. This class encapsulates functionalities related to quantum state manipulation.

### Quantum Noise Simulation
- **File**: `quantum_noise.py`
- **Description**: Implements functions for simulating noise in quantum systems. It includes the creation of noise models (e.g., depolarizing, amplitude damping) and applying noise to quantum circuits, allowing for realistic simulations of quantum operations.

### Data Preprocessing for Quantum Machine Learning
- **File**: `quantum_data_preprocessing.py`
- **Description**: Contains functions for preprocessing data for quantum machine learning applications. This includes normalization, encoding classical data into quantum states, and splitting datasets for training and testing.

### Feature Maps for Quantum Machine Learning
- **File**: `quantum_feature_maps.py`
- **Description**: Implements various feature maps used in quantum machine learning, such as Z-Feature Maps and Pauli Feature Maps. These feature maps encode classical data into quantum states, which is essential for quantum algorithms.
